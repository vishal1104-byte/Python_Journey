# 1. Program to add,subtract,multiply,divide two numbers 
# a = int(input("Enter the First Number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the Second NUmber: "))
# print("The Sum of Two Numbers is \n",a+b)
# print("The Product of Two Numbers is\n ",a*b)
# print("The Subtraction of Two Numbers is\n",a-b)
# print("The Division of Two Numbers\n",a/b)

# 2. program to find a remainder when a number is divided by Two 
# Number=int(input("Enter The Number "))
# div=int(input("Enter the number of division"))
# remainder=Number%div
# print(f"The Remainder of {Number} is {remainder}")

# # 3. Using comparison Operator Find out whether a given variable a is greater than b or not 
# a=34
# b=63
# if(a<b):
#      print("a is Smaller")
# else:
#      print("a is greater ")

# 4. Write a python program to find out the average of two number given by the user

# a=int(input("Enter the first Number \n"))
# b=int(input("Enter the second Number\n"))
# avg=(a+b)/2
# print("Average of Two Numbers is \n",avg)

# 5. Write a python Program to find out the square and cube  of the Number given by the user 

# num=int(input("Enter the Number to get the Square,cube of that Number\n"))
# sq=num*num
# cu=num*num*num
# print("The Square of ",num,"is",sq)
# print("The Cube of the",num,"is",cu)
