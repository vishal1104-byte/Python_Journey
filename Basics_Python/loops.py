'''
In python, Loops are control structures used to execute a block of code repeatidely until a certain condition is met . They allow you to automate tasks.


Primary there are two types of loops in python 
1. For loops
2. while loops 
'''


'''
While Loops ---> A while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedely until a given condition is satisfied . And when the condition becomes false , the line immediately after the loops in the programm is executed 
'''
# count = 1
# while count <= 5:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1


# Write a python program to print all the even numbers between 1 and 50 using while loops 
# num = 0
# while num <= 50:
#     if num%2 == 0:
#         print(num)
#     num += 1

'''
For Loops --->  The for loop in python is indeed used to iterate over sequences such as lists,tuples,strings,dictionaries and ranges . It allows you to execute a block of code for each item in the sequences
