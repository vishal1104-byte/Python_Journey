2. Comparison Operators 

== equals to 
<= less than equals 
>= greater than equals 
!= not equals to 


 3. Assignment Operators 

a += 11   SO here 11 will be added after the value of a 
a -= 11   So here 11 will be subtracted after the value of a 
a *= 11   So here 11 will be multiply by the previously value of a 

4.  Logical Operators :- Operates on the bollena value 

bool1 = "True"
bool2 = "False"
print("The Value of bool1 and bool2 is ",(bool1 and bool2))
print("The Value of bool1 and bool2 is ",(bool1 or bool2))
print("The Value of not  bool2 is ",( not bool2))
