A number can be converted into strings and vice versa

'''
input() function :- This function allows the users to take input from the keyboard as a string 

a = input("Enter Your Name")

Note that the output of input is always a string(even if the number is entered)!
But if you want to take number as a input so do this 
a = int(input("Enter the Number ))
