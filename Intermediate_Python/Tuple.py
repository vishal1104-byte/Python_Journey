# tuple = ("Vishal","Sahil","Batuk","Patel")
# print(tuple)                            # This is  the basic list 
# print(len(tuple))                    # This is the length function we use this to know the length of a tuple 

# tuple2 = (1,2,3,4,5)
# tuple3 = (True,False,True)             # tuple item can any data types 
# tuple4 = ("Vishal",11,True)
# print(tuple4)
# print(type(tuple2))                     # type() function in tuple is used to know the data type of a tuple 


# Note : All others funtions of tuple are same such as Accessing the tuple, updating the tuple,loop tuple,join tuple,etc
